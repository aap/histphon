The goal of this project is to simulate regular sound change in a nice way.
The core of this is a regular expression engine that works on sounds
(segments) modeled as a set of distinctive features. This is unlike lga
(q.v. here on github), which worked on text. The regular expressions
(legex) are matched, then substitutions are applied to the matches.

A language that describes language change in a tree like fashion will be the
next step.

It's all still rather early. Legexes and substitutions are basically working
already but they only operate on segments. In the future suprasegmental
features should be supported as well.
